"rabbit placement"
in this code we ask the user to enter the number of the box where they want to place the rabbit 🐇.
we give him 3 distinct lists with salad symbol, the moment he chooses the box we remove the salad with the remove function, and we replace it with the index of the box and the rabbit.
